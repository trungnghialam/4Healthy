										This website is about lifestyle and it is for people in any ages.
										 This would be popular for people who like to search information via Internet. Because there are
										 many good points in the website so it could encourage people to increase exercise and decrease
										 screen time.
									</p>
										<p>The purpose of this website is for people who want to get information about doing exercise.
											This means that some people are first time to do exercise and they have no idea how to do it.
											Moreover, there is an important feature which is about recipe how to make healthy dishes.
											Some people eat too much after exercise so this feature would help them to solve that issue.</p>

							<p>The healthy eating feature helps you to eat consciously every day to keep you fit.
								This website recommends you daily diet based on your workout. The diet is divided into categories based on the exercises performed such as shredded workout or bulk workout.
								The feature suggests how much nutrients you should intake throughout the day to gain a healthy body such as protein intake, calories, carbohydrates etc.
								This feature also allows you to track your daily food intake to tally it with the recommended amount.
								It tracks your daily calorie consumption and the calories burned post workout. You can also set the amount
								of calorie you need to burn during the whole day as well as it shows recommended calorie limit.
								It also follows the three-life rule. If you are overeating and exercising less,
								then one life will be taken off each time you over eat. All entertainments would be shut down when all
								three lives are lost, and you can resume after three days of proper diet

								The first feature of 4 healthy is that the user can actually connect with the social medias or games on phone via wifi.
								The role of this feature would be that a timer would be set by the user by which user wants to play any game or use social media.
								And when the time is done, automatically the app the user would be using would get shut off and would not open till an appropriate time.
								This would at most help those who mostly engage themselves in just sitting and using apps like WhatsApp, snapchat or Instagram or
								even games and because of this they do not indulge themselves in any physical activity.
